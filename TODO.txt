SURVIVORS

- Executioner
	- polish and stuff
		- custom tracers? mando's fmj doesn't fit
			- this is a non-trivial issue due to networking shenanigans
	- how to register palettes?
	- how to register logbook?
	- should he be an unlock? if so - how?

- Nemesis Commando
	- has sprites and a simple kit so would be fun to try to get in as a secret unlock

- Items
	- figure out armed backpack tracer
	- add meter for watch metronome
	- watch metronome may have occasionally broken behavior? unable to replicate atm
	- ADD MORE MUAHAHAHAHA

- Try adding an unlockable?

- (ideal) SCOPE:
- One survivor (Executioner)
- AT LEAST 8 items (Fork, Dormant Fungus, Diary, Jet Boots, Blood Tester, Speakers, Insecticide, Gem Breacher, Portable Reactor? - one per cat, one per tier)
